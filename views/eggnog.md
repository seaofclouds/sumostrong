# Sumo Strong Egg Nog

Approximate yield: 3 liters, or 100 fl oz

## INGREDIENTS

- 12 large eggs
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 quart (4 cups) whole milk
- 1 liter (about 4 cups) bourbon (Maker's Mark, Woodford Reserve or your choice.)
- 1/2 cup dark rum (Kraken or Myer's)
- 1/2 to 1 cup good Cognac or other brandy
- Pinch kosher salt
- 1 whole nutmeg
- Aluminum Foil
- Several Glass Bottles

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Separate egg yolks and whites. (Reserve the whites for another use.)
2. Combine yolks and sugar in a large mixing bowl and whisk until well blended and creamy.
3. Add cream, milk, bourbon, rum, Cognac, and salt, then stir.
4. Bottle immediately (An old liquor bottle works great, as do 22-ounce bail-top bottles.)
5. Keep refrigerated for at least 3 weeks, or up to a year if you can.

> ### PRO TIP
>
> Prior to refrigeration, itâ€™s traditional to wrap the bottle in aluminum foil, shiny side out, together with a fresh nut of nutmeg tucked into the foil for grating later.

> ### WARNING
>
> Consuming raw eggs can mess you up. Go easy, friend.
